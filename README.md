# Standard Driven Development (SDD)

**Turning standards and best practices into executable tests for AI coding agents.**

---

## The problem

AI coding agents are incredibly powerful — but they are not deterministic.

They can generate large amounts of code quickly, yet turning that code into **secure, reliable and production-ready software** remains difficult.

The core challenge is simple:

**How do you know when AI-generated code is “good enough”?**

If you ask an LLM to improve security, quality or architecture, it will always find something to refine. This process can continue indefinitely, making it hard to know when your system is truly ready for production.

Teams need **objective guardrails**.

## The idea

Fortunately, software engineering is not starting from scratch.

Over the years, experts have created:
- industry standards  
- security frameworks  
- accessibility guidelines  
- engineering best practices  

These resources already define what “good” looks like.

What’s missing is a way to make them **executable for AI-driven development**.

## What is SDD?

**Standard Driven Development (SDD)** is a framework that transforms standards and best practices into:

- automated tests  
- AI-assisted audits  
- human verification checklists  

This allows teams to:
- know when AI-generated code meets real-world standards  
- systematically apply guardrails to coding agents  
- move from endless iteration to measurable readiness  

Tests are automated whenever possible.  
Audits can be performed by AI.  
Humans intervene only when necessary — and at the right time.
