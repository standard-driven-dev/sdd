# MVP Activation Scope
# Reference: https://standard-driven.dev/spec/activation/mvp.yaml

metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2026-02-18"
  scope: "MVP"
  rationale: |
    Start with 7 core standards covering security, accessibility, privacy, performance, 
    and quality. Expand to additional standards as the framework matures.

# Active Standards (MVP)
standards:
  - standard_id: std:owasp_asvs
    status: active
    rationale: Core security verification standard for web applications
    chapters_active: [V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6]

  - standard_id: std:wcag_2_1
    status: active
    rationale: Accessibility requirements for educational platforms used by children

  - standard_id: std:gdpr
    status: active
    rationale: Privacy compliance for handling student data (children = special category)

  - standard_id: std:core_web_vitals
    status: active
    rationale: Performance metrics critical for LMS user experience

  - standard_id: std:arc42
    status: active
    rationale: Architecture quality model for maintainable codebase
    focus_areas: [security, maintainability, reliability]

  - standard_id: std:gestalt
    status: active
    rationale: Visual design principles for consistent UI

  - standard_id: std:hicks_law
    status: active
    rationale: UX optimization for minimizing cognitive load

# Deferred Standards (Future)
deferred:
  - standard_id: std:iso_27001
    rationale: Enterprise certification - not needed for MVP

  - standard_id: std:owasp_top_10
    rationale: Covered by ASVS - redundant for MVP

  - standard_id: std:xapi
    rationale: Learning data standard - phase 2
